gaia-doc-diagrams
==================

Some documentation diagrams for Mozilla Boot-2-Gecko (Firefox OS) Gaia, created by me.

The "really canonical" copy resides on my Google Docs Drawing of my MoCo account, and the SVG files
and the rasterized assets are only for reference. The rasterized assets are referenced in
Gaia codebase comments too.
